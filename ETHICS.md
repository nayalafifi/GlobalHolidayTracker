# Ethical Considerations in Web Scraping

## Respecting Website Policies

- **Robots.txt Compliance**: Before scraping, we checked [timeanddate.com's robots.txt](https://www.timeanddate.com/robots.txt) to ensure we are allowed to scrape the `/holidays/` section.
- **Terms of Service**: We reviewed the website's terms of service to ensure our actions don't violate any policies.

## Minimal Server Load

- **Single Request**: The script makes only one HTTP request to the website per run, minimizing the load on the server.
- **Rate Limiting**: Although we make a single request, we have implemented a delay mechanism (using `time.sleep()`) in case of future enhancements that may require multiple requests.

## Data Use and Privacy

- **Public Data**: We only extract publicly available information that is accessible to all users without authentication.
- **No Personal Data**: The script does not collect or process any personal or sensitive data.

## Attribution

- **Credit to Source**: We acknowledge timeanddate.com as the source of the data and include links back to the original website in our documentation.

## Responsible Use

- **Educational Purposes**: This project is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate web scraping techniques.
- **No Commercial Use**: We do not use the scraped data for commercial gain or distribute it unlawfully.

## Compliance with Laws

- **Legal Considerations**: We ensured that our scraping activities comply with relevant laws and regulations, including copyright and data protection laws.

## Mitigation of Potential Harms

- **Error Handling**: We included error handling to prevent accidental overloading of the server due to unforeseen errors or infinite loops.
- **Ethical Coding Practices**: The code is written to be transparent and ethical, avoiding any deceptive or malicious practices.
